reFocus for Kodi
============

### Warning !
This project is no longer being actively maintained. The master branch should run without big problems on Kodi 17.0 / Krypton however.

I have started a new skin for Kodi called Grid, which is currently in beta stages. More information and download instructions are available [here](https://forum.kodi.tv/showthread.php?tid=318152).


### About
reFocus is a graphical interface for Kodi that understands your media is what truly matters. Elegance, simplicity, refinement, consistency and balanced design are keywords for this skin.

### Download and installation
For instructions please see the wiki (https://github.com/jeroenpardon/skin.refocus/wiki#installing-refocus)
